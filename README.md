Use this repo to upload all the code you write for the first module. 

Do not stop at hello world, work through as many programs as you can in Chapter 2 
of our textbook, and the many videos that are posted in our first module.

Develop a study habit of setting aside time to code. Do not wait until the last minute 
to try and get all your programs done!
